    <p>The main way I give back to my community is through my involvement in the <a href="https://cybr.club"
            target="_blank">Texas A&M Cybersecurity Club</a>. As Vice
        President, I work to ensure the club runs smoothly and that as many students are informed about the
        opportunities we provide as possible. As Cisco Academy Lead, I share my passion for networking with dozens of
        students each semester, oftentimes having the opportunity to introduce them to networking entirely. I also help
        students earn their CCNA, setting them up for a successful technical career. I am truly grateful for this
        opportunity I have to help my fellow Aggies.</p>
