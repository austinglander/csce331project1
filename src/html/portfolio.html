    <h1>Portfolio</h1>
    <p>In the past year, I have had a lot of opportunities to work on some really fun projects, both small and large.
        Check out some of my favorite personal projects below.</p>
    <div class="homelab">
        <h2>Homelab</h2>
        <p>This is my favorite, largest, and longest running project - my first homelab! As the story goes, my roommate
            liked to use his old gaming PC as a "living room computer" to be connected to the TV for watching YouTube,
            googling, etc. When we moved in together, he let me know about his failed attempts to get a <a
                href="https://jellyfin.org/" target="_blank">Jellyfin Media Server</a> running and asked me if I might
            know how to do something like that. I had NO idea how to do ANYTHING like that, but I took it upon myself to
            try. After installing Ubuntu and a few long nights of browsing old forum posts and banging my head against
            our crappy <a href="https://a.co/d/bGvnBqs" target="_blank">Logitech K400</a>, we had a Jellyfin server! But
            now I need something called a reverse proxy? And TLS certs? And a domain? And DNS records? And more
            services? Long story short, I learned it all, and it has been a great experience. Here are some of the
            current services:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Tailscale (for secure remote-access)</li>
            <li>Nginx Proxy Manager</li>
            <li>Jellyfin Media Server</li>
            <li>AMP Game Panel</li>
            <li>Pihole</li>
            <li>Some one-off Python web-servers that I'm surprised are still functioning on reboot</li>
            <li>A modded Minecraft server for my coworkers and manager from my internship at <a href="https://mimic.com"
                    target="_blank">Mimic</a></li>
            <li>A vanilla Minecraft server for my roommates and friends</li>
            <li>Various other on-demand game servers</li>
            <li>Something at <a href="https://austin.gl/ander" target="_blank">austin.gl/ander</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Some of my future aspirations include moving the homelab to a Proxmox High Availability Cluster hosted on a
            few mini PCs on a server rack, getting enough smart home equipment to justify using Home Assistant,
            running all of my services via Docker containers deployed via Docker Compose, and documenting everything on my GitHub.</p>

    <div class="voxelgrid">
        <h2>Voxelgrid</h2>
        <p>It turns out I have some really smart and talented friends. One of which made his own 8x8x8 grid of LEDs,
            controllable via Python scripts. It is visually similar to the one shown in <a
                href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9c-ASBcYWiA" target="_blank">this video</a>, if you'd like a
            visual aid. I was really fascinated by the project, so I asked (forced) him to explain how he interfaces
            with it. Using that knowledge, I put together a suite of scripts for him to run on it, including a 3D snake
            game, 3D pong, and <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/bad-apple" target="_blank">Bad Apple!!</a> in
            full 8x8 glory. To test my work, I used ChatGPT to help build me a renderer using OpenGL. With the help of
            this renderer, I'm proud to say
            that all of my code worked FIRST TRY when we actually got a chance to test it out on the hardware.</p>

        <h2>Wooden Nickel</h2>
        <p>One day, while playing <i>The Binding of Isaac</i>, I ran into a sequence of favorable events that was almost
            unbelievable. I couldn't sleep at night without having <i>some</i> idea of the odds of what happened. So,
            with the slightest bit of stastistics knowledge under my belt from my stats class that had started a few
            weeks
            prior, I constructed a statistical model of the event, and predicted that I could expect an outcome as
            favorable or more favorable than mine approximately 1 in 1,409,244 tries. Pretty lucky!

            <p>Please enjoy a graph of the probability density of 1,000,000 attempts. For context, my luck landed me at
                36 on the x-axis out of a technical maximum of 50.</p>
