            <blockquote>
                <p>I need you to generate an engaging webpage that educates the user on me, Austin Glander. It should be
                    relevant to me and my interests, professional, and based off of all of our prior engagements. Your
                    ultimate goal is to present the capabilities of artificial intelligence for generating web content.
                    This prompt should be included in its unaltered entirety within the page. You must generate ONLY
                    html. That means no inline CSS or JavaScript. You may include external links if desired. You must
                    include a navbar at the top of the page that links to index.html, portfolio.html,
                    qualifications.html, service.html, and ai.html (you are writing ai.html itself).</p>

            <article>
                <h3>Networking Education</h3>
                <p>Short, conceptual primers followed by guided labs (often in Packet Tracer or on real Cisco gear).
                    Students
                    practice VLAN planning, trunking, Rapid PVST, and Link Aggregation; later, they layer on routing,
                    ACLs, and
                    IPv6.</p>

            </article>

            <article>
                <h3>Homelab &amp; Reliability</h3>
                <p>Multi-container services behind a reverse proxy, internal DNS, and clean network segmentation.
                    Experiments
                    with 4×4 vehicles and portable edge nodes occasionally meet a love of field networking and
                    telemetry.</p>

            </article>

            <article>
                <h3>Software &amp; Teaching Tools</h3>
                <p>From a JavaFX “Foodtruck” app to Discord bots and subnetting games, Austin builds playful utilities
                    that
                    teach real skills. Current interests include React-based learning tools and visualizers for routing
                    and
                    binary arithmetic.</p>

            </article>

            <article>
                <h3>Curiosity for Internet Operations</h3>
                <p>Deep dives into historical routing incidents and the practical tradeoffs of anycast, peering
                    policies, and
                    router safeguards—bridging theory and real-world operations.</p>

            <h2 id="showcase-title">What AI Can Generate for Web Content</h2>
            <p>This page itself was produced from the prompt above and prior context, with no CSS or JavaScript. Here
                are
                patterns AI can deliver quickly while staying aligned to your voice and goals:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Audience-aware structure:</strong> Clear headings, summaries, and “why it matters” callouts
                    for
                    learners vs. practitioners.</li>
                <li><strong>Reusable sections:</strong> “About,” “Focus Areas,” and “Capabilities” blocks that port
                    across your
                    site.</li>
                <li><strong>Documentation-ready markup:</strong> Lists, figures, and semantic HTML that can be styled
                    later
                    without rewrites.</li>
                <li><strong>Pedagogical scaffolding:</strong> Stepwise lab plans, checklists, and assessment prompts
                    tailored to
                    CCNA learners.</li>
                <li><strong>Tone &amp; precision control:</strong> Neutral, concise copy with concrete terms favored by
                    technical audiences.</li>
                <li><strong>Rapid iteration:</strong> Update a single prompt, regenerate sections, and keep the site
                    consistent.
                </li>
            </ul>

                    <li>Assemble a content map (About, Interests, Labs, AI capabilities).</li>
                    <li>Render clean, accessible HTML with semantic tags.</li>
                    <li>Link to internal pages and reputable external references.</li>

                    <li>Keep user privacy in mind; share only what’s relevant and consented.</li>
                    <li>Invite review: AI drafts fast; humans keep it correct and authentic.</li>

            <h2 id="learning-title">Teaching Philosophy</h2>
            <p>Lead with intuition, then formalize. Show the “why,” then the CLI. Make labs bite-sized and
                confidence-building,
                with optional depth for advanced students. Encourage note-taking, self-tests, and post-lab retros.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Concept → Command → Consequence:</strong> Understand, configure, verify.</li>
                <li><strong>Minimal friction:</strong> Known-good baselines and clear rollback steps.</li>
                <li><strong>Realistic failure:</strong> Use safe, instructive breakages to build instincts.</li>
